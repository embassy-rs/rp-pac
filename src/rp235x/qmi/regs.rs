The default hold time is one system clock cycle. Note that flash datasheets usually give chip select active hold time from the last *rising* edge of SCK, and so even zero hold from the last falling edge would be safe. Note that this is a minimum hold time guaranteed by the QMI: the actual chip select active hold may be slightly longer for read transfers with low clock divisors and/or high sample delays. Specifically, if the point two cycles after the last RX data sample is later than the last SCK falling edge, then the hold time is measured from *this* point. Note also that, in case the final SCK pulse is masked to save energy (true for non-DTR reads when COOLDOWN is disabled or PAGE_BREAK is reached), all of QMI's timing logic behaves as though the clock pulse were still present. The SELECT_HOLD time is applied from the point where the last SCK falling edge would be if the clock pulse were not masked."]
